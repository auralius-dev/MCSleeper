# MCSleeper

**A Minecraft server tool to help you save energy.**

Requires Node.js.\
Just download the source in a subdirectory of your server(recommended) then configure the config.js.

- Please report problems in [issues](https://github.com/auralius-dev/MCSleeper/issues).
- Request features in [issues](https://github.com/auralius-dev/MCSleeper/issues) if you want.

Thanks for reading!

---
Config options are constantly being added because I use this tool myself.\
If you use this tool, and you want a feature for your server ask in [issues](https://github.com/auralius-dev/MCSleeper/issues) and I might implement it.
